# Page-Level-BI
Page Level Security (PLS) in Power BI is not a built-in feature like Row-Level Security (RLS), but you can implement it using a combination of RLS, bookmarks, and dynamic filtering. Since you have an employee table with empID, emailid, and department name, you can set up Page Level Security where pages are visible based on the user's department.
